Configuration of my R environment and a small collection of useful scripts

The *.Rprofile* is loaded every time you startup an R shell. It will load a bunch of useful packages and sets a couple of environmental and global variables. To use it just link/copy it into your home folder

## Scripts

#### package_installation.R

And the corresponding *Rinit.sh* will initialize a new R environment by installing a bunch of packages I use on a regular basis.
