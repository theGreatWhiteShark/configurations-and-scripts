Various helpful configuration files.

#### .xmodmap

This one defines which keystroke is related to which keystroke is related to which character/symbol.

Since I almost never use the tabs lock and on the other hand it is quite annoying when you hit it by mistake, I just disabled this button for good. 

#### .xinitrc

Init file for X11. This little script will turn of the blank screen occurring after some minutes. Especially in i3 I found this to be quite annoying.

#### .xprofile

I want to be my second screen to be always left of my laptop.
